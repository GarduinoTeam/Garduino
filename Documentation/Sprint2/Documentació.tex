\caption{Application use cases diagram}
\label{figure2}
\end{figure} \newpage\leavevmode \\
 Figure \textcolor{blue}{ \ref{figure2}} shows the following actors: the user, the web service, the Rpi and the Admin.\newline\newline
The user will be able to log in, ask for their installations to be shown and edit them. He can also monitor his own installations. They can also create, modify, delete and list both their rules and irrigation conditions. In order to irrigate, the user will be able to irrigate their facilities manually and with irrigation conditions. All these functionalities are received by the Web Service which will wait for the requests that are made from the Android application and this one will ask for the necessary information to the Rpi to be able to give this information to the Android part and consequently to show it. \newline\newline
The admin will be able to logge, request that all the installations are shown as well as to create them, to modify them and to eliminate them. He can also monitor them. You can then create, modify, delete and list all rules, irrigation conditions and users. In order to water, the admin will be able to water all installations manually and with watering conditions. All these functionalities are received by the Web Service which will wait for the requests that are made from the frontend of the web part and it will request the necessary information to the Rpi to be able to give this information to the part of the frontend and consequently to show it.   
\newpage

\section{General architecture}
\subsection{System architecture}
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{AppArchitecture.png}
\caption{System app architecture}
\end{figure}

The architecture of our application is composed by:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Android App}: Graphical interface, in charge of collecting the data entered by the user. We are doing it using Android Studio.
\item \textbf{Web Service}: Makes middleware of the application. It manages requests between the Android app and the RPi/NodeMCU, the database, the frontend ...
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} Graphical interface used by the web application administrator to perform operations against the backend of the webservice and monitor the status of each user's devices, thus allowing absolute control of the data to be given to the administrator.
    \item \textbf{Backend:} It is in charge of communicating with the android application, frontend and Rpi, receiving your requests, processing the data and preparing a response. It will act as the middleware of our system and therefore, will have more computational load.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{RPi/NodeMCU}: Device that will be in charge of the irrigation of each environment (gardening, flowerpot, ...).
\item \textbf{Database}: Manage all the data of the application, user credentials, register all requests, device info, ... 
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsection{RPi/NodeMCU architecture}
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{IrrigationSystem.png}
\caption{Arduino and rapsberry pi architecture}
\end{figure}


So, we have the following components
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Raspberry pi 3B}: We will use this microprocessor to ask the slaves for information about the sensors and the webcam, and then return the call to the web service with all the data.

\item \textbf{NodeMCU ESP8266}: It will act as a device slave, in charge of collecting sensor data, activating irrigation and capturing our plant. This microcontroller will have a wifi module to maintain a wireless communication with the RPi(\textbf{R}aspberry \textbf{Pi}).

\item \textbf{Webcam ESP32}: This module will be in charge of capturing the plant and sending the data to your NodeMCU.

\item \textbf{Relay}: Useful to control a motor, a led strip, or any other module using arduino. The use is sumple, just connect a digital output of our esp8266 to our relay module, and then we can control a power-demanding appliance with the digital signal provided by the esp8266.

\item \textbf{Water pump}: He will be in charge of pumping the water in order to carry out the irrigation correctly.

\item \textbf{Power supply}: Our devices will need a source of energy, in this case we have chosen a power supply of 12V to batteries. In the future it could be exchanged for a solar panel or even make a hybrid between the two depending on the climate.

\item \textbf{Soil moisture sensor}: Measures the volumetric water content in soil. Since the direct gravimetric measurement of free soil moisture requires removing, drying, and weighing of a sample, soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using some other property of the soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant, or interaction with neutrons, as a proxy for the moisture content.

\item \textbf{DHT sensor}: This sensor will allow us to simultaneously measure temperature and humidity. We have two types of DHT sensors, DHT11 and DHT22.\\

The DHT11 is a very limited sensor that we can use for training, testing, or in projects that don't really require accurate measurement.\\

The DHT22 has acceptable features for use in real monitoring or logging projects that require medium accuracy.\\ 

In this project we will start implementing the DHT11 version due to its low cost (70 cents).
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section{Data model}
%% Data model
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ModelDeDades.png}
\caption{Data model UML}
\end{figure}
In this data model diagram we can see how our data is structured and related with the different datatables. We explain the target of the different tables:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{User}: It stores all the data related to our users.

\item \textbf{Request}: It is used to store the requests of the users  to a specific device and to check if these requests have been completed. 

\item \textbf{Mode}: It stores the different kind of requests that a user can do  like manual irrigations, conditional irrigations, the obtainment of the sensor data.

\item \textbf{Device}: It stores the information of a device which corresponds to a user. It can have a default rule, so the user has not need to create its own. 

\item \textbf{Sensor}: It stores the value of a sensor of a specific type which correspond to a device.

\item \textbf{SensorType}: It stores the different type of sensors which are: Humidity, Temperature, Soil.

\item \textbf{Rule}: It stores all the configurations which correspond to a device. It can have RuleConditions and TimeConditions.

\item \textbf{RuleCondition}: It stores the conditions  with its respective value. It corresponds to a rule and a condition. If the sensors data of a device accomplish these conditions then an irrigation is produced.  

\item \textbf{RuleTimeCondition}: It corresponds to the conditions of a rule which a user decides when an irrigation has to be produced.  With the status we determine if this condition has to be considered.

\item \textbf{Condition}: It stores the different conditions which are: Temperature is lower than,Temperature is greater than, Humidity is lower than,  Humidity is greater than, Soil is lower than, Soil is greater than.
\end{itemize}

We have made some changes regarding the data model of the previous sprint in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Table:} An admin field has been added to distinguish between normal and admin users.
    \item \textbf{Device Table:} Image field has been removed since the Web Service use a file system storage to store the images of the devices. For example, to create a new device for a user with id=1 with name device 1 the path would be: \{ServerHome\}/1/device1.png.
    \item \textbf{ status\_rule} and \textbf{default\_rule} were not necessary since the satus of a rule is controlled yet and the \textbf{default\_rule} is the type of a User Rule or Admin Rule.
    \item \textbf{SensorType Table:} The field type is now the name field.
    \item \textbf{Condition Table:} The field type was not used.
    \item \textbf{RuleTimeCondition Table:} The specific\_dates field is now an array of dates.
\end{itemize}

\\ \\
Screen 4 shows the control panel of a device when there is a manual irrigation in progress. It indicates how much irrigation time is left, and offers the option of cancelling it instantaneously. 
\\ \\
Screen 5 shows the configuration menu of a device. It offers the option to change its name, change the frequency of updating information and access to a panel to modify the irrigation rules. All changes will be saved when you press the save button. 
\\ \\
Screen 6 shows the configuration panel of a device's irrigation ruleset. It shows the list of rules, which can be activated and deactivated by means of a switch, and these can be modified by clicking on them. It shows the option to add new rules and the option to save changes.
\\ \\
Screen 7 shows the irrigation rule creation screen. You can choose its name, confirm its creation and cancel it. This screen will be converted to a pop-up in the near future of the development of the project. 
\\ \\
Screen 8 shows the configuration panel of the irrigation rules of a device after a new irrigation rule has been created. The internal configuration of this can now be accessed and modified by clicking on its name. 
\\ \\
Screen 9 shows the configuration panel of an irrigation rule. This will consist of various conditions, which can be activated and deactivated through the use of a switch. It offers the option to modify the parameters of the conditions, as well as to create a new one and save the changes in that irrigation rule. 
\\ \\
Screen 10 shows the screen to add a new condition. It shows the different types of conditions that are available. 
\\ \\
Screen 11 shows the configuration of a time condition. It shows the various options for which the condition will be active: start and end time of the days it will be active, configuration by days of the week, by months in which it will be active, and specific dates in which the time condition will be active. 
\\ \\
Screen 12 shows the modification of one of the parameters related to the time of a time condition (start time and end time). The specific times can be selected by specifying them in a clock. 
\\ \\
Screen 13 shows the modification of the parameters relative to the specific dates in which the time condition will operate. The specific days can be chosen by means of a calendar. 
\\ \\
As an improvement of the previous prototype, some screens have been changed by the pop-ups corresponding to these in order to streamline navigation and maintain an awareness of the location between the various screens on which the user navigates at all times.
